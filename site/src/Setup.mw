The current RC 0.3 documentation site is [http://scala-scales.googlecode.com/svn/sites/scales/scales-xml_2.9.2/0.3-RC7/index.html here] and a zip of the site documentation is available at [http://scala-scales.googlecode.com/svn/sites/scales/scales-xml_2.9.2/0.3-RC7/org.scalesxml-scales-xml-0.3-RC7-site.zip scales-xml.zip].

Scales is cross compiled for 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.1 and 2.9.2.
