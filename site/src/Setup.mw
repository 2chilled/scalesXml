Maven users should use scales-xml_2.9.2 as the dependency (org.scalesxml as the group).

The 0.4.4 documentation site is [http://scala-scales.googlecode.com/svn/sites/scales/scales-xml_2.9.2/0.4.4/index.html here] and a zip of the site documentation is available at [http://scala-scales.googlecode.com/svn/sites/scales/scales-xml_2.9.2/0.4.4/org.scalesxml-scales-xml-0.4.4-site.zip scales-xml.zip].

Scales is cross compiled for 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 (with 2.10.0-RC2 builds and more to follow).

== Sbt 0.11.x ==

${cscala}

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  // just for the core library
  "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-xml" % "0.4.4" 
  // and additionally use these for String based XPaths
  "org.scalesxml" %% "scales-jaxen" % "0.4.4" intransitive(),
  "jaxen" % "jaxen" % "1.1.3" intransitive()
)
${cend}


If using the 2.10.0 RC candidates and sbt 0.12.1 please also use:
${cscala}
     cross CrossVersion.full
${cend}
against the dependencies (as the RCs are not guaranteed to be binary compatible).
