= XPath Embedded DSL =

The XML XPath specifications allows navigation of XML documents via a DSL that describes routes through a document using a combination of axe, steps and predicates.  It has a limited number of these abstractions but together they create a poweverful, often both direct and simple to use, querying language.

Scales provides this power via both a traditional string based approach and an embedded DSL that leverages the power of Scalas syntactical flexibility to mimic the XPath syntax.

The DSL uses the existing Scales abstractions to the full, and works via a zipper over the XmlTree itself.  Each navigation step through the tree creates new zippers and new paths through the tree.

In every case possible (at time 0.3 the only known exception is the namespace:: axis) the range of behaviours is identical to the specification.  Instead of matching on prefixes Scales uses fully qualified expanded QNames (qualifiedName in the [XPathFunctions.html#QName_Functions QName Functions]) to match against, not requiring a context within which to run.

== Simple Usage Examples ==

Given the following document:

${cscala}
  val ns = Namespace("test:uri")
  val nsa = Namespace("test:uri:attribs")
  val nsp = nsa.prefixed("pre")

  val builder = 
    ns("Elem") /@ (nsa("pre", "attr1") -> "val1",
      	    	   "attr2" -> "val2",
		   nsp("attr3") -> "val3") /(
      ns("Child"),
      "Mixed Content",
      ns("Child2") /( ns("Subchild") ~> "text" )
    )
